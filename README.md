# About
	This repo contains my solutions for various problems assigned to me in my
	Machine Learning class. Each project has varying structure/quality, as I 
	used these assignments as a chance to experiment with code organization in 
	Python and the SKLearn API. 
	
    knn_and_decision_tree - kNN and Decision tree implementations
	linear_regression - Linear Regression using normal equations vs. gradient descent.
	logistic_regression - Logistic Regression from scratch vs. SKLearn
	sklearn_and_tf_experiments - RandomForest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression from Tensorflow and SKLearn
	bagging_experiment - Bagging. Currently only uses one classifier.
