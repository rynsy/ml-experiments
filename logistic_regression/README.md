Name: Ryan Lindsey

The main code/presentation is in the Logistic+Regression+Classifier.html file, which can be viewed in any browser.

My code is mostly in part1.py, but I've made some updates in the main iPython notebook. The source code for the iPython
notebook can be found in the notebook folder.

Run 'make setup' to prepare the directory to run the program.
